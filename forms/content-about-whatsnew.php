                <p>
                    The new plugin version has been mostly rewritten, and more then 80% of the plugin code has been replaced or improved. The plugin has gone through various visual changes, and includes more layouts to choose from.

                <h3>Improved look and feel</h3>
                <p>
                    Most of the plugin default styling has been replaced or enhanced. The plugin improves how the template packages are handled, how the CSS and JS is loaded and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Plugin has new icons, and they are used a lot more now (and they can be disabled too.). Plugin has extensive options to control layouts, styling and displayed elements in various contexts.

                <h3>Block Editor Support</h3>
                <p>
                    A lot of old shortcodes and widgets are now available as blocks for block editor. These new blocks will require WordPress 5.6 or newer to work. More blocks will be added in future versions of the plugin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All blocks have sidebar/inspector settings and offer instant preview as any other WordPress block, and each one has various settings to adjust how the block content is displayed.

                <p>
                    Most of the plugin templates have been modified, and some considerably so. The naming conventions for the templates have been improved, more templates added.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With that, the main styling files have been reorganized and improved, and now, font with icons is built into CSS file to allow for better loading performance.

                <h3>Shared Library and Interface updates</h3>
                <p>
                    The plugin uses brand new shared code Dev4Press Library 3.6. This means that it uses improved admin side interface, it has lighter code base, and more of the plugin code is controlled throught the library.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Plugin dashboard is improved, and it also features new information.

                    With all the changes made in this version, a lot of old code is no longer used. Over 100 functions and files have been deprecated, and Shortcake UI support has been deprecated.

                <p>
                    Version 5.0 also fixes many bugs. Some of the issues were reported in the past few months (but were low priority), and some were discovered during this development process.
